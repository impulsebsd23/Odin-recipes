    <h2>
        This recipe was passed from my Yia Yia to her daughter-in-law (my mother) to me. People love this as a Christmas gift. It has gained a big reputation among our friends. One time, my mother donated a small tin of baklava to a church charity auction. It was very competitive, but the price was driven up to $40!

        <li>4 whole cloves</li>

        <li>1 lemon, juiced, divided</li>
    </ul>

        <li>1 pound finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir together water, 2 cups sugar, cloves, cinnamon stick, and 1/2 the lemon juice together in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until flavor blends and syrup consistency is reached, about 15 minutes. Stir remaining 1/2 the lemon juice into syrup. Strain and refrigerate until cool, at least 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir walnuts, 1 cup sugar, ground cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush butter on the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Lay the phyllo dough out on a clean, dry surface and cover it with plastic wrap. Cover the plastic wrap with a damp towel.</li>
        <li>Lay 1 sheet of phyllo dough in prepared baking dish and lightly brush with butter. Lay another 1 sheet of phyllo dough on top, brush with butter. Repeat layering and brushing with butter with 4 more sheets of phyllo dough. </li>
        <li>Gently spread 1/3 the walnut mixture in an even layer over the phyllo dough in the baking dish. Place a sheet of phyllo dough over the walnut mixture and brush it with butter. Repeat layering and buttering with 3 more sheets of dough.</li>
        <li>Spread another 1/3 the walnut mixture in an even layer over the phyllo dough in the baking dish. Place a sheet of phyllo dough over the walnut mixture and brush it with butter. Repeat layering and buttering with 3 more sheets of dough. </li>
        <li>Spread the remaining 1/3 walnut mixture in an even layer over the phyllo dough in the baking dish. Place a sheet of phyllo dough over the walnut mixture and brush it with butter. Repeat layering and buttering with the remaining 5 sheets of dough. Cut baklava into 1-inch diamonds. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour cooled syrup over baked baklava and cool for 1 day to absorb syrup. </li>
    </ol>
